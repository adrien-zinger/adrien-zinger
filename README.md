# Here is all my bg projects

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

### Luc 
A P2P architecture developed in **_Rust_** that is a swiss knife were I put everything I think interessant or funny to do.
This start with a chat that and to a asynchrone logger in a P2P network.
<!--
It will lead to a data sharing system between code repositories through the network. But it can be usefull for some hack because it should implement a global synchronisation in small groups. A project orchestra has to be implemented to check if multiple nodes can be synchronised. And finaly I want to use my projects Diff and TF-IDF to provide a datasharing system fully synchronised with the help of git bare repositories.

It can also go throught another way, the synchronisation can be usefull to execute authorised codes or compiling code on multiple kernells, I want also use the asynchrone/synchrone to implement races and gates in the network.
